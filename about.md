I’m Roger Stringer, and I’m a web and mobile software developer in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. This is where I write and share. You will see everything from reviews, posts about tech and design, to food.

I work heavily with [Twilio][1], PHP and WordPress, so you'll see some posts about both of those on here, as well as a variety of other topics.

I'm also a dad, music lover and a [chef][2]. I spend my spare time doing fun stuff with my daughter, and cooking up new recipes to post on here as well as on my food blogs.

I'm also a type-2 insulin dependant diabetic, so once in a while, you'll see some posts related to that as well.

I'm the founder and sole developer of [TheInterviewr][3], which launched in July 2011 and has been [growing steadily since][4]

### Additional Endeavors

  * I wrote the [Twilio Cookbook][5] for Pakt Publishing
  * Lead developer and project manager at [Freekrai.net][6]
  * Founder and sole developer for [WorkerPod.com][7], a job search site that brings together job listings from across the Internet and geared towards tech professionals
  * Founder and sole developer for [DBStract][8], a site that lets people create their own web apps.
  * Founder and Editor of [FoodJumper.com][9].
  * Developer of [ErgoTxt][10], an hourly random text message reminding people to get up and do something.
  * Developer of the [Jolt Micro Framework][11] for PHP, and the [KayFish][12] framework, also for PHP.

### Colophon

This site is coded by hand in [Coda 2][13] on an 13&#8243; MacBook Pro with Retina, and [Diet Coda][14] on an iPad Air. It is powered by [WordPress][15] and is hosted on a [MediaTemple Grid][16] Server.

I use [Byword][17] and [Poster][18] to draft and edit posts, usually on either my MacBook Pro, my iPad, iPad Mini or my iPhone.
